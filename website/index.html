<h1>XBox HID Driver for Mac OS X (v1.0 - May 18, 2003)</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This software enables the XBox USB gamepad on Mac OS X by installing a HID (Human Interface Device) kernel extension in the system extensions folder. It is completely free, with an optional donation to support future development. The source code is also included, and is subject to the <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/">Apple Public Source License</a>.<br>
<p>While it currently only supports gamepads, this driver can be extended to support other XBox devices, including wheels, IR receivers, headsets, and memory units.

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Before you download, please note: this driver requires <b>Mac OS X 10.2.6 or later</b>, which was recently released, so make sure to upgrade. The download contains a detailed ReadMe with information about known bugs and limitations, which you should consult first before emailing me.
