<h2>About</h2>
<p>This software enables the Xbox USB gamepad, DVD remote, and other Xbox devices on Mac OS X. It installs a HID (Human Interface Device) kernel extension and works at a low-level so any game that supports joysticks can use it. Games that do not support joysticks can use Xbox devices through additional software such as <a href="http://www.carvware.com/gamepadcompanion.html">GamePad Companion</a>.

<p>You can use the Xbox HID Driver as long as you want, it is now freeware and totally unlimited. The full source code is accessible via CVS.

<p>The source code to the kernel extension component is included, and is subject to the <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/apsl/">Apple Public Source License (APSL)</a>. The driver can be extended to support additional Xbox devices, including wheels, IR receivers, headsets, and memory units. The full source code for other components is licensed under the GPL.

<p>It is now possible to use the Xbox controller in Halo! Halo version 1.5 supports gamepads!

<p>I have created an Application Enhancer module (aka haxie) that taps into Halo Mac Edition to provide limited joystick support, I call it "Game Pad Hack". <i>Update: this is no longer needed in version 1.5 of Halo</i>. I probably will not be continuing development of this haxie but the full source code is available for anyone who would like to take it further. Click <a href="GPH-0.3.sit">here</a> to download Game Pad Hack (requires the Xbox HID Driver).

<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<p>I'm maintaining an <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for common problems and help getting various games to work with the Xbox controller.

<p>The download contains a detailed Readme which might help you.

<p>Also, <a  href="http://www.lik-sang.com"><image src="lsi_button88x33_1.gif" border="0"></image><a> is hosting a forum where you can get help running your favorite game/application with Xbox devices, voice complaints, start a flame war about controller design, etc. Click <a href="http://forum.lik-sang.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=3&likref=macHID">here</a> to visit the forum.

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.insidemacgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9513&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0">forum</a> at <a href="www.insidemacgames.com">Inside Mac Games</a>.



<h2>Getting a USB Adapter</h2>
<p>I used to recommend <a  href="http://www.lik-sang.com">Lik-Sang</a> for this as they donated some hardware to test on. It seems they are out of business now. I would recommend you search google. It is also possible to build your own adapter with some basic soldering skills and an old printer cable. Again, search google, lots of good howtos on this can be found.

<h2>Related Software</h2>

This software may help you get your controller working with games that do not support HID input.

<p><a href="http://www.orderedbytes.com">ControllerMate</a> is a programmable utility that can be used to emulate a keyboard or mouse with your Xbox controller.

<p><a href="http://www.carvware.com/gamepadcompanion.html">Gamepad Companion</a> is a similiar utility for mouse/keyboard emulation.

<p><a href="http://www.zsculpt.com/website/appsutils/hidwizard">HID Wizard</a> is a free utility to map HID joysticks onto the keyboard/mouse.

<p><a href="http://alphaomega.software.free.fr/joystickandgamepadtester/Joystick%20And%20Gamepad%20Tester.html">Joystick and Gamepad Tester</a> provides you with some low-level information on your gamepad.

<p>There is another project supporing the <a href="http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver
">Xbox 360 controller here</a>, it also supports force feedback. It is not clear if this also supports the original Xbox controllers.

<h2>Donations</h2>
<p>Donations will be used to purchase additional Xbox devices and gadgets, and  will motivate future updates and enhancements (calibration w/dead zones, rapid-fire buttons, invertable axes, 3rd-party controllers...).
